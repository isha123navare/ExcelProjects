    Outlet Location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
    Item Type (categories like Baked Goods, Frozen Foods, etc.)
  Visualizations Section: Includes charts and graphs for detailed analysis.
2. Visualizations Created
Total Sales by Fat Content:
Created a pie chart to display the proportion of sales from Regular and Low-Fat items.
Total Sales by Item Type:
